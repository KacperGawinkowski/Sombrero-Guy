# SombreroGuy
First PJATK Gamejam project

„Sombrero Guy” was a game made during the 24-hour Game Jam organized by The Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw. Out of the 100 contenders taking part in the competition, our team was the one that took the prize home! Before the competition started we drew the game jam topic, which was “It shouldn’t be doing that”, which explains why the game has some intentional problems.

Players goal is to collect burritos and avoid being caught by the policemen!  Once you collect all 4 of them you should return to your home (starting position). Then, you win the game. Good luck!
